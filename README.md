# About Me

### Who are you? What is your background?
My name is Jack Schultheis. I'm from Latrobe, PA and I went to college for Finance and Economics. I currently work for a Energy Trading Company.
### What are your career goals?
I hope to one day work as a quant analyst and create algo trading models at a hedge fund.
### Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?
A lot of finance and tech jobs now require analysts to know how to code. I hope to use my skills I learn in this FinTech bootcamp in my daily work.
